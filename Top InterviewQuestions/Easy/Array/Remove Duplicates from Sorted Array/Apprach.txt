Thought Process

- Since, the question mentions uniqueness of numbers, the immediate thought
  is to use a HashSet.
- However, the question also mentions modifications have to be incorporated
  into the original array itself
- Hence, I have used HashMap to store all unique elements, using their index
  as a key.
- The choice to choose index as key comes handly, as the original array itself
  is sorted in ascending order, so every time we find a unique number, we can simply
  increase index value (this will serve as the index on which this element has to be modified)
  and store the unique value
- Finally, we only have to iterate k times (size of the hashmap), and using the index as key
  fetch the value, and make the apppopriate modification into the original array
